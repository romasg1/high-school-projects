# 🎓 High School Projects

Welcome to my collection of projects from my **6-year high school program** with a focus on **programming** at GVID 🖥️.  

During these years, the main focus was on **programming in C**, which gave me a strong foundation in algorithms, data structures, and low-level programming concepts. Additionally, I also worked on smaller projects in **Java, HTML, CSS**, and other languages, giving me a well-rounded perspective on software development 🌐.  

This repository contains a selection of projects I completed during my studies. Some projects may be missing or unpublished, but the ones included showcase my skills and progress.  

The projects cover topics such as:  
- 🔗 Dynamic data structures (linked lists, queues, stacks) in C  
- 🔍 Searching and sorting algorithms  
- 📝 Various programming exercises and assignments in C, Java, and web development  
- 🌐 HTML, CSS, and simple web-based projects  

Included is my **graduation project — a Training Diary** implemented as a linked list with pointers in C, representing the culmination of my programming studies.  

These projects reflect my growth, learning, and hands-on experience in programming throughout my high school years.  

💡 **Note:** This collection is primarily for demonstration purposes and to showcase my programming journey during high school.
