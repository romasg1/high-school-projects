# High School Projects

This repository contains a selection of projects completed during my studies at GVID high school. These are the projects I was able to find and publish here; some others may be missing or unpublished.

The projects cover topics such as dynamic data structures, searching algorithms, and more.

Included is my graduation project — a **Training Diary** implemented as a linked list with pointers — which represents the culmination of my studies.

These projects demonstrate my skills and learning progress during high school.
